This project contains the files for my Array-Manipulation project.
The html file acts as an interface for the user to input variables into an array.
The array will be shown to the user in the form of an unordered list and elements of the array are displayed to the user as list items.
The user can:
- Add to the end of the array (push)
- Add to the start of the array (unshift)
- Remove the last element of the array (pop)
- Remove the first element of the array (shift)
- Remove the element at a specifix index (splice)
