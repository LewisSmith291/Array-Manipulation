# Array Manipulation Project
## Description
    This project contains the files for my Array-Manipulation project.
    The html file acts as an interface for the user to input variables into an array.
    The array will be shown to the user with an 'old computer console' thematic.
## Features
The user can:
    - Add to the end of the array (push)
    - Add to the start of the array (unshift)
    - Remove the last element of the array (pop)
    - Remove the first element of the array (shift)
    - Remove the element at a specifix index (splice)
